# ICL-Year-2-Mathematics-Group-Project
## <ins>Project Purpose</ins>:
The purpose of this group project is to encourage team work and communication skills, required in any kind of research or in employment. The mathematical content of each project is important, but so is the process of working with others to produce a report, and to prepare an oral presentation to a strict deadline.
<br/>
## <ins>Project Overview</ins>:
This report is strongly related to the Complex Analysis module (MATH95007) and Metric Spaces & Topology module (MATH95008) and focuses on two main applications of conformal mapping:
<br/>
- Fluid Flow
- Medical Imaging
This project took approximately 3 weeks to complete, which involved a collaboration between 5 Mathematics students (international and UK). We produced a 30 page project at the end of the course and achieved a raw mark of 86% in the module.
