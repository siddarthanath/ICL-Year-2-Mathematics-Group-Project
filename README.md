# ICL-Year-2-Mathematics-Group-Project
## M2R Project (group of 5) focussing on Conformal Mappings and their applications
<br/>
The purpose of this group project is to encourage team work and communication skills, required in any kind of research or in employment. The mathematical content of each project is important, but so is the process of working with others to produce a report, and to prepare an oral presentation to a strict deadline.
<br/>
## <ins>Project Criteria</ins>:
1. The report should be produced using LaTeX. 
  - It should have clear organisation, and should include acontents list and a list of references. 
  - The suggested length is about 20-25 sides (of double-spaced A4) for a group of 4, or about 25-30 for a group of 5. But these guidelines are not rigid. 
  - You can put supplementary material in appendices if you want to.
2. All sources, including web pages, should be fully referenced in the bibliography, and indicated in the text itself. 
  - Any help from outside the group should be acknowledged. 
  - If you copy text or diagrams from a book or a journal or the internet or another person this must be acknowledged in the text, and there must be a corresponding reference in the bibliography. 
  - All members of the group are jointly responsible for ensuring that this has been done in all parts of the project. 
3. Due to the special circumstances this year, there will be no live presentations. Instead, we will ask you to prerecord your group presentations. 
  - This can be done, for example, by recording an MS Teams session, in which you take turns to voice over different parts of a shared slide presentation. 
  - Note that there should be an overall flow to your presentation, it should not be 4 or 5 individual presentations glued together.

## <ins>Grading Criteria</ins>:
#### Written report (80%)
<br/>
Presentation – 20%; Contents – 40%; Mathematical Rigour, Initiative and Bonus – 20%
  - The project will be marked by two members of staff with expertise in the broad area of the project.
  - Usually, every member of the group receives the same mark for the written report.
<br/>
#### Oral presentation (20%)
<br/>
The mark is based on the assessment of the two markers who will also mark your written report. 
  - The assessors will award individual marks for each student presenting.
